                  Ignite your nostalgia with this Bop-it! virtual game, modeled
                  after the beloved 90's Hasbro toy. This Vanilla JS game offers
                  two game play modes: a conventional timed mode similar to
                  Hasbro's standard gameplay, and a memory-based game where all
                  that matters is sequence.
